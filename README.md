# EE2016-Washing-Machine-Project

## Microprocessor Theory & Lab - Course Project

This repository contains the code and the report for the final project of the EE2016 course done during Jul-Nov 2019. 

The project involved implementing a fully functional controller for a washing machine using an *AVR ATMEL ATmega8* microcontroller. It simulates different user settings and conditions and is entirely programmed in Assembly Language. 
A small demonstration of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DfUmkOichvVzVCwFdtpW9M7bJfMWhnw/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Ut6ZEmGT4).
