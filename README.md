# EE2016-Washing-Machine-Project
### Microprocessor Theory & Lab - Course Project
This repository contains the code and the report for the final project of the EE2016 course done during Jul-Nov 2019. 

The project involves implementing a fully functional controller for a washing machine using an **AVR ATmega8** microcontroller and it simulates different user settings and loading conditions. 

It implements the following flowchart:
